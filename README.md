You need to install the mysqlconnector so that we can connect sql to python.
Connect your Mysql to Local Host.
Make sure you create a database of name "encryption_final".
And automatically it will create tables in database if doesnot exist.
It will take message from user and encrypt it in such a way that the characters are shifted to third position from right. Example for 'hi' message the encrypted message 'kl' will be stored in the database and when user wants to retrieve the message it will decrypt it and show the sender and reciever of that message as well.
